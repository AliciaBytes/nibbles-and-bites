# Nibbles & Bites

Nibbles & Bites is the component system for polycule.li and is probably not useful for anyone else. It's very limited on purposefully only supports what we need.

It currently contains the following components:

- Asides
    - Danger
    - Hint
    - Information
    - Warning
- Navigation
- Picture Figure
- Remote SVG
- Section Divider
- Spoiler & Inline Spoiler
- Theme Switcher & Toggle

as well as very importantly: A consisten style and theme for the websites.

Feel free to [poke around](https://github.com/AliciaBytes/nibbles-and-bites) or even use it, but don't expect any support with it.
